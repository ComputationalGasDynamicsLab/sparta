These input scripts demonstrate use of the compute collision/tally and
compute reaction/tally commands.  Each produces a dump file which
tallies information about gas/surface collisions or reactions.

The in.circle.tally script is adapated from examples/circle/in.circle

The in.circle.gs.tally script is adapated from
examples/surf_react_adsorb/in.circle.gs
